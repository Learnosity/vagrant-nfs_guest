## How can I contribute?

#### I think I've found a bug

* Firstly cool! We can hopefully make the project better by your discovery.

* Before you submit an _Issue_ please have a scan through any existing or closed Issues to make sure you've found something unique and unreported.
  
* If your issue seems unique and unreported, you should open a GitHub _Issue_.

    * In your Issue report, please include as much information as you can.
        * A detailed summary of the error you are seeing, and any information you think is relevant.
        * A snippet of your Vagrantfile showing your `vagrant-nfs_guest` shared, and the network settings used.
        * The version of Vagrant, the host and guest operating system, which VM provider and it's version.
        * A simple example Vagrantfile that demonstrates the error would be super useful if possible.
        
#### I've found a bug and I've fixed it!

* Wow, awesome! This will help greatly!

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Please send us a PR, all input and suggestions welcome. All assistance greatfully accepted and appreciated.

#### I have an idea for a feature, can you please add it?

* Vagrant-nfs_guest is used daily by our in-house team and is well tested and used. So any new feature that doesn't impact our daily usage or is very specific to your use-case probably won't get the investment in time you might require. We don't want to disappoint you, but the facts of life are sometimes "if you want it done, you have to do it yourself". We will happily help you where we can, and we will joyfully accept any PRs you come up with, but we will not just add any feature that's requested.

#### But it's a really really good idea!

* Again, if it's a world beating idea, put something together (even if it's pseudo-code) and a good document on the problem you're trying to fix and the value of your feature. Then submit a PR.
