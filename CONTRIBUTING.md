## How can I contribute?

#### I think I've found a bug

* Firstly cool! We can hopefully make the project better by your discovery.

* Before you submit an **Issue** please have a scan through any existing or closed Issues to make sure you've found something unique and unreported.
  
* If your issue seems unique and unreported, you should open a GitHub **Issue**.

    * In your Issue report, please include as much information as you can.
        * A detailed summary of the error you are seeing, and any information you think is relevant.
        * A snippet of your Vagrantfile showing your `vagrant-nfs_guest` share, and the network settings used.
        * The version of Vagrant, the host and guest operating system, which VM provider and it's version.
        * A simple example Vagrantfile that demonstrates the error (this would be super useful if possible).
        
    * [You should then create a new issue](https://github.com/Learnosity/vagrant-nfs_guest/issues/new)
        
#### I've found a bug and I've fixed it!

* **Please send us a PR, all input and suggestions welcome. All assistance greatfully accepted and appreciated.**

#### I have an idea for a feature, can you please add it?

`vagrant-nfs_guest` is used daily by our in-house team and is well used and tested. So any new feature that doesn't impact our daily usage or is very specific to your use-case probably won't get the investment in time you might require.

We don't want to disappoint you, but the facts of life are sometimes _"if you want it done, you have to do it yourself"_. We will happily help you where we can, and we will joyfully accept any PRs you come up with, but we will not just add any feature that's requested.

#### But it's a really really good idea!

Again, if it's a world beating idea, put something together (even if it's pseudo-code) and a good document on the problem you're trying to fix and the value of your feature. Then submit a PR.
